## Getting Started 

##### Limitations  
The indexing of a crash dump is limited to 268,435,392 objects, instances on the heap. This is because of
.NET object size limit of 2 GB. I might deal with this later.
The MDRDesk top is using a lot of memory, the largest crash dump, I tested, has size of 15,090,522,609 bytes and contains 165,448,895 objects.
