## Credits
1. [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime](https://github.com/Microsoft/clrmd)  
   Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime.dll (nicknamed "CLR MD") is a process and crash dump introspection library. This allows you to write tools and debugger plugins which can do thing similar to SOS and PSSCOR.
2. [Markdown.XAML](https://github.com/theunrepentantgeek/Markdown.XAML)  
   Markdown XAML is a port of the popular MarkdownSharp Markdown processor, but with one very significant difference: Instead of rendering to a string containing HTML, it renders to a FlowDocument suitable for embedding into a WPF window or usercontrol.
3. [WPF Flat Combo Box Style](https://gist.github.com/hansmaad/9187633)  
   MDRDesk message boxes are using Hannes Kamecke's WPF Flat Combo Box Style.
4. [MSAGL](https://github.com/Microsoft/automatic-graph-layout)  
   MSAGL was developed in Microsoft by Lev Nachmanson, Sergey Pupyrev, Tim Dwyer, Ted Hart, and Roman Prutkin.  
   MSAGL is a .NET library and tool for graph layout and viewing.
5. [Enumerating Circuits and Loops in Graphs with Self-Arcs and Multiple-Arcs K. A. Hawick and H. A. James](http://complexity.massey.ac.nz/cstn/013/cstn-013.pdf)  
   K.A. Hawick and H.A. James extended the circuit enumeration algorithm of Johnson for graphs with directed-arcs, multiple-arcs and self-arcs.
